**Intermediate Instructor:** Coding Minds Academy - Remote, CA - Summer 2023
- Taught one on one courses for K-12 students on the topics of programming and game design.
- Languages and tools included C++, Java, Python, and C#/Unity.

**Teaching Assistant CS251 (C / C++):** Haverford College -  [David Wonnacot](https://www.haverford.edu/users/dwonnaco) and [John Dougherty](https://www.haverford.edu/users/jdougher) - Fall 2022
- Assisted students with labs and homework on the topics of computer architecture; programming languages and idioms; Haverford Educational RISC Architecture (HERA).
- Collaborated with professors Dougherty and Wonnacott to optimize the learning experience both in the classroom and during TA office hours.

**Machine Learning Intern (Python):** Haverford College - [Rajesh Kumar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/raj28sep/), Summers 2020 and 2021
- Goal: Develop a technique for continuous authentication for use in high security applications.
- Implemented and compared 1D and 2D CNNs with traditional neural networks with the task of differentiating between users’ biometric mouse signatures. Results: The 2D CNN outperformed our other methods.

## Additional Experience

**Shader Engine** Winter 2024
- Implemented a rendering pipeline using OpenGL (C++) for writing compute shaders in GLSL
- Created an ImGui UI and added functionality for serializing and updating properties in real time
- Designed an interactable Conway shader, slime simulation, and boid simulation 


**Archaeological Reconstruction Using Shape Grammars (C# / Unity):** Spring and Fall 2022
- Thesis advised by Professor [Aline Normoyle](https://alinen.net/) 
- Researched shape grammars as a tool to procedurally generate structures and cities.
- Implemented a version of L-Systems to generate raster images of fractals and trees. 
- Designed a grammar in Unity Engine to visualize the pre-Columbian city of Pachacamac (Peru) 
- Designed my own interpreted scripting language and used it to manipulate models in Unity.
